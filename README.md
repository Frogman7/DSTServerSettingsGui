# Description
Provides a graphical user interface for easy changing of dedicated server settings.  I wasn't a huge fan of editing the text file and thought hey wouldn't it be great if there was an easier way and thus this tool was born.  Written in Qt and C++ for cross platform support.

# Development Status
This is a "work in progress" and by no means complete.  Basic functionality seems to be there but this is practically untested at this stage so use at your own risk.

Wishlist for the 'release'
- Styled so it looks modern
- Better message handling if there are errors opening or saving files
- Linux (and possibly Mac) if it doesn't already work
- Add expandable area for 'Advanced' options
- Add another tabbed screen for 'World Generation' options.
- Document code

# Notes
I'm a C# developer by trade so this was a new experience for me forcing me outside my comfort zone to learn something new.  I tried my best to follow good practices buy I'm sure there are improvements to be made.  If anyone viewing my work has any comments they'd like to make please feel free and if anyones interesting in contributing message me I'd love to talk improvements with another developer!
